# Image Trainer
## A simple UI for previewing images and dropping them into directories which can be later used to create training data for a classifier.

### Requirements
  - Python 3
  - Tkinter

## Usage
Run python3 ImageTrainer.py.

Drop your unclassified image files in the Unclassified directory and start the application. Write all of the classes that come to mind in the provided text box and click classify.

If you browse to the Classified directory, the image will now be present in a directory of each class name you specified.
